# Password-Generator

In this challenge I created a password generator with JavaScript. I created a prompt that asks the user to pick a password length from 8 to 128 characters. When the user selects a number they click the ok button and that takes them to a series of character prompts. The user needs to select yes to at least one of the character prompt. Once the user finishes the prompts they are given a password displayed in the text box that mathes characters they chose in the prompts. Below I attatched the screen shot of the webpage, the deployed website URL and the URl to the GitHub repository.
